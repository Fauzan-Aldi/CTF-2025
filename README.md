# CTF 2025 

Hello and welcome to my write-up for CTF 2025!
This year, I participated in the International Open Division with a random team due to last-minute registration. Despite the chaos, I managed to complete all the forensic challenges, complete all the game challenges, complete some misc. challenges.

Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the web and blockchain challenge this time, which motivated me to sharpen my skills in that area.
I hope you enjoyed reading this simple post.
Happy hacking and learning!

## Challenge Solved

### 1. I Cant Manipulate People (Forensic)

#### Descriptions

Open the provided `traffic.pcap` file in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Apply filter icmp to display only ICMP packets. Examine the data field in the packet details pane will notice a single letter. Manually extract the letters from each packet in the sequence they appear. Combine the extracted letters to form the flag.

#### Steps

1. filter icmp protocol

3. flag: `WGMY{1e3b71d57e466ab71b43c2641a4b34f4}`

### 2. Oh Man (Forensic)

#### Descriptions

Open [Online PCAP Analysis](https://apackets.com/upload) and upload the file `wgmy-ohman.pcapng` for analysis. Examine the parsed data and got interesting credentials hash **NTLMSSP authentication**. Use [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) to crack the hash and the password retrieved is `password<3`. Open the `wgmy-ohman.pcapng` file in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Apply the cracked password `password<3` in the **NTLMSSP protocol** to decrypt the packets. Export all the reconstructed files from the decrypted traffic in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Two Interesting files are `20241225_1939.log` and `RxHmEj`. Open `20241225_1939.log` in [hex editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/). The file header is broken and fix it by adding string `MDMP` at the beginning of the file. Run [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz) to extract information from the repaired log file. Review the output to extract sensitive information, including the flag.

#### Steps

1. Upload and find interesting credentials hash

### 3. Tricky Malware (Forensic)

#### Descriptions

Open the file `memdump.mem` using [MemProcFS](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS) to create a virtual drive. Inspect the virtual drive for suspicious files or processes. Identify a suspicious file named `crypt.exe`. Tried to decrypt `crypt.exe` but was unsuccessful. Afterthat, open the file `network.pcap` using [Online PCAP Analysis](https://apackets.com/upload) got interesting network to the `pastebin.com`. Tried to cross-check with memory dump by run strings and grep `pastebin.com` reveals a link to pastebin page. Open the link to obtain the direct flag.

#### Steps

1. load MemProcFS file memdump.mem

#### Descriptions

Run the file command on the provided file to identify its type. Suspecting it might be an image, change the file extension to `.jpg` and try opening it. The file fails to load as an image. Open the file in [hex editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/). Discovered suspicious strings, such as `meow`. scattered throughout the file. Create a script to remove all occurrences of the meow string and recontruct the file. After running the script, obtain a clear image file. Open the image, which now loads correctly. The flag is embedded within in the images.

#### Steps

1. run `file flag.shredded`

```python
# Script to clean the shredded file
input_file = "flag.shredded"
output_file = "flag_cleaned.jpg"

with open(input_file, "rb") as infile:
    data = infile.read()

# Remove all occurrences of "meow"
cleaned_data = data.replace(b"meow", b"")

with open(output_file, "wb") as outfile:
    outfile.write(cleaned_data)

print(f"Cleaned file saved as {output_file}")

```
4. clear image after running the python script

Open the game in browser and use Inspect Element to analyze its structure. Discover that the game is embedded via an iframe. Navigate to the iframe source to locate the game's JavaScript files for further examination. Identify the interesting code snippet in one of the JS files. Focus the `$dataWeapons` array to manipulate the in-game weapon stats. use the following payload to maximize the weapon's power `$dataWeapons[5].params = [999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999, 999];`.

```python
from typing import List

def extract_flag(file_path: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
    # Open the file in binary mode and read its content
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_content = file.read()

    # Locate the start of the flag (e.g., "WGMY")
    elements = []
    offset = file_content.find(b'WGMY') + 4  # Start reading after "WGMY"
    
    # Extract alphanumeric characters following "WGMY"
    while offset < len(file_content):
        element = file_content[offset:offset + 1].decode(errors='ignore')  # Decode bytes to string
        if element.isalnum():  # Include only alphanumeric characters
            elements.append(element)
        offset += 4  # Move to the next element based on observed pattern
    
    # Use the given indices to extract specific elements
    flag_elements = [elements[i] for i in indices]

    # Combine the extracted elements to form the flag
    flag = "wgmy{" + "".join(flag_elements) + "}"
    return flag

# Example usage
file_path = 'challenge.dcm'
indices = [25, 10, 0, 3, 17, 19, 23, 27, 4, 13, 20, 8, 24, 21, 31, 15, 7, 29, 6, 1, 9, 30, 22, 5, 28, 18, 26, 11, 2, 14, 16, 12]
flag = extract_flag(file_path, indices)
print(flag)

```

4. flag: `wgmy{51fadeb6cc77504db336850d53623177}`
